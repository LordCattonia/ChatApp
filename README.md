### Setup/Install

##### IMPORTANT:  

If on Windows 10, install Windows Terminal from [here](https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windows-terminal/9N0DX20HK701) beforehand.  
You then need to either restart your computer or restart Windows Explorer (The Task Manager way).

##### Other OSes:

- Step 1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

- Step 2. Download the project by clicking [here](https://github.com/LordCattonia/ChatApp/archive/refs/heads/master.zip) and extract.

- Step 3. When in the folder (not .zip) that contains `main.js` right click on an area without files and select `Open in Terminal`.

- Step 4. When the terminal opens type in `node .` (yes, with a space) and then press enter.

- Step 4. Head to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
