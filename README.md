# ChatApp
### A really bad project
This is my first big project. I am using JS, CSS and HTML<br>
Libraries for JS: Socket.IO and Express.
### Setup/Install
Step 1. Download and unzip by using the GUI or ```git clone https://github.com/LordCattonia/ChatApp.git```<br>
Step 2. Make sure Node.js is installed on your system and in PATH (Windows).<br>
Step 3. Open the ChatApp file in terminal or CMD and run ```node main.js```<br>
Step 4. Head to ```localhost:3000``` on your browser<br>
<br>Please report bugs to me
